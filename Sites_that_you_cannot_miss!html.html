<h1> Sites that you cannot miss! </h1>
<p> Possibly one of the most influential counties in regards to culture and heritage; Spain is a place that everyone must see in their lifetime. From the beaches in Tenerife to the famed Casa Milà in Barcelona, the list of cultural experiences available to you in Spain is endless. </p>
<h2> A bit about the geography of Spain </h2>
<p1> Spain is located in southwestern Europe. It occupies most of the Iberian Peninsula and includes a small exclave inside France called Llívia as well as the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, and also the the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, and five places of sovereignty (plazas de soberanía). </p1>
<h3> Places to see </h3>
<p2> With so many monuments, museums and sites on offer, I will list just a few things that you cannot miss out on your trip to Spain... </p2>

<div class="text-center">
<h4> Sagrada Família </h4>
<img src="sagrada_familia.gif">
<div p3> The Sagrada Famílía is a large unfinished Roman Catholic church in Barcelona which was designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí. Gaudí's work on the building is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and in November 2010 Pope Benedict XVI even consecrated and proclaimed it a minor basilica, as distinct from a cathedral, which must be the seat of a bishop. It is something that can't be left out on your trip to Spain! </p3>

<h5> Park Güell </h5>
